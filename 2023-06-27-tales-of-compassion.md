**Is compassion in the way of beecentric beekeeping?** A reflection / food for thoughts.
How we think about bees, but cannot think like one.


Empathy and altruism are part of the animal kingdom, but compassion (deliberate action to reduce other’s suffering) is something humans might express more prominently than other animals. 
Saving a bee from a spider is displaced compassion. A feel-good moment, a relief for the prey but affecting the predator’s survival and those depending on it. However, ending the suffering of an animal hit by a car is compassionate. Yet no one feels good about doing it.

Honey bees are not compassionate, **they are altruistic, adaptive, opportunistic and run a tight ship**: any injured, sick, unproductive queens or workers, obsolete drones are expelled or executed. Outsiders can be accepted but never rescued. They don’t go out of their way to feed another colony in distress, they rob them. In line with a bee-centric approach, how true to that can we stay? We are embracing natural selection but are happy to intervene in case of struggle, sometimes pushing for the survival of the weakest or encouraging the hegemony of some species (as seen with feeding birds). We have learned to force the hand of natural selection.
“Let the bees be bees” may be sound but intervention is always around the corner.

In a bee world > victims of robbing, predators and dearth fill up the backstage of the survival scene. But it’s Not a “natural” thing for us to accept. We are compassionate social animals after all. (i hope). We do respond to the suffering of others.
On display when…Feeding Bees (also regarding pests and disease.)
Done both (feeding/not feeding needy colonies) and felt conflicted on both situations. I decided not to feed (currently). But that’s me. Not the “humane” thing to do? It’s NOT out of compassion but with a self-sustainable bee population in mind. Not spoon fed. The area should provide bees with adequate, diverse food. It is challenged by management choices, weather or situations bees wouldn’t place themselves into, in the wild. WILD…this is the key word. Bees are wild, **MANAGEABLE insects**. Dearth and nectar shortage will affect all bees/pollinators, managed and unmanaged. Yet feeding the wild bee population in forests is not the norm. 

We do so out of PROFIT, some COMPASSION and a touch of GUILT. 

* it’s “only for emergencies” or “ time for that nuc to chin up”.
* “atonement” for taking too much or setting up a new colony while conditions were not optimum. Or to reduce losses > business.
* “duty of care” /peers' judgement. A sense of responsibility for interfering with natural selection.
* “What” / “when” to feed is more complex than just syrup > impact on colony health. 
* it is a business for some > income dependance means minimising losses.

 **Held straight or standing straight.** 
 
If bees depend on us for survival…it should be about making sure their habitat can sustain them. It’s Not about creating dependance to justify our role (> some Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy or Noah syndrom**). It is also about accepting vulnerability as part of beekeeping. A hard one. We always wonder “Are they OK?"

>****Noah syndrom**:
>Animal hoarding, sometimes called Noah syndrome
> is keeping a higher-than-usual number of animals as domestic pets without the ability to properly house or care for them, while at the same time denying this inability. Compulsive hoarding can be characterized as a symptom of a mental disorder rather than deliberate cruelty towards animals.
